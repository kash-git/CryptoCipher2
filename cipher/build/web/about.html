            This project proposes a java-based web application which converts a plain text into a cypher text with the
            help of a encryptor. This project provides a person to send some crucial and authentic data to someone
            without any sense of fear to get the data leaked. The cypher text can be decrypted with the help of a key
            which will always be different for each cypher text.

            RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two
            different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to
            everyone and the Private key is kept private.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The idea!</strong> The idea of RSA is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize a large
            integer. The public
            key consists of two numbers where one number is a multiplication of two large prime numbers. And private key
            is also derived from the same two prime numbers. So if somebody can factorize the large number, the private
            key is compromised. Therefore encryption strength totally lies on the key size and if we double or triple
            the key size, the strength of encryption increases exponentially. RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048
            bits long

            RSA algorithm uses the following procedure to generate public and private keys:
        <ul>
            <li>Select two large prime numbers, p and q.</li>
            <li>Multiply these numbers to find n = p x q, where n is called the modulus for encryption and decryption.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose a number e less than n, such that n is relatively prime to (p - 1) x (q -1). It means that e and
                (p - 1) x (q - 1) have no common factor except 1. Choose "e" such that 1&lte &lt φ (n), e is prime to φ
                (n),
                gcd (e,d(n))=1
            </li>
            <li>If n = p x q, then the public key is <e, n>. A plaintext message m is encrypted using public key &lte,
                    n&gt. To find ciphertext from the plain text following formula is used to get ciphertext C.
                    C = me mod n
                    Here, m must be less than n. A larger message (>n) is treated as a concatenation of messages, each
                    of which is encrypted separately.
            </li>
            <li>
                To determine the private key, we use the following formula to calculate the d such that:
                De mod {(p - 1) x (q - 1)} = 1
                Or
                De mod φ (n) = 1
            </li>
            <li>
                The private key is &ltd, n&gt. A ciphertext message c is decrypted using private key &ltd, n&gt. To calculate
                        plain text m from the ciphertext c following formula is used to get plain text m.
                        m = cd mod n
            </li>
        </ul>
